##Clustering of High-Z quasars from SDSS
- Sample contains 4,426 luminous optical quasars
- Redshift $2.9 \leq z \leq 5.4$
- Power law fit $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$: 
	- $r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}Mpc$.
	- $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$
	- Scale range $4 \leq r_p \leq 150 h^{-1}Mpc$
- For $z \approx 1.5$, $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}Mpc$
- Sample is devided into two redshift bins assuming $\gamma = 2.0$:-
- $2.9 \leq z \leq 3.5$:
	- $r_0 = 16.9\pm 1.7h^{-1}Mpc$
	- $Duty = 0.004 \sim 0.05$ 
	- $t_Q = 4 \sim 50 Myr$
	- $M_{min} = 2-3 \times 10^{12} h^{-1}M_0$
	- $b_{eff}\sim8$ at $z=3.0$
- $z \geq 3.5$:
	- $r_0 = 24.3\pm 2.4 h^{-1}Mpc$
	- $Duty = 0.03 \sim 0.6$
	- $t_Q = 30 \sim 600 Myr$
	- $M_{min} = 4-6\times10^{12}h^{-1}M_0$
	- $b_{eff} \sim 16$ at $z = 4.5$


### Questions

- Why data is devided into two bins?
- What does it mean to say, quasar locus crosses the stellar locus in color space at $z \approx 2.7$ [Fan 1999]?
- What is the quasar selection algorithm in SDSS?
- Overlapping plates?
- 
### Sample selection

- 2.5 wide-field telescope, drift scan camera with 30 CCDs, images sky in 5 boad bands ($ugriz$)
- Candiates for followup spectroscopy are selected using their colors, and arranged in spectro plates for [[double spectroscopy]]
- Spectroscopy is carried out over 5740 $deg^2$.
- Selection algorithm:
	- $z\leq 3.5$ are outliers from the stellar locus in the ugri color cube.
	- $z>3.5$ are outliers from the griz color cube.
- Quasar candidate sample is flux limited to $i = 19.1$ and at $z > 3$ to $i = 20.2$.

- Mg II line has a small and known offset from the systemic redshift.
